We improved the accuracy of Parallel CNN-LSTM with attention mechanisms from 93.81% to 96.91% by adjusting the learning rate schedule using ReduceLROnPlateau. My part focused on data preprocessing, where I performed feature extraction to mel spectrograms and added white Gaussian noise to enhance the model's robustness.
